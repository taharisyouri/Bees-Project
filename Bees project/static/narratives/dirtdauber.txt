Dirt dauber 
Dirt daubers are slender solitary wasps that build tube-like mud nests on walls, under eaves, or in sheltered spots. They hunt spiders, paralyze them, and stock them in the nest for their young. They’re usually non-aggressive and rarely sting. If you find old nests, they’re often abandoned and can be scraped off easily.
