Bumble bee

Bumble bees are fuzzy, strong pollinators that can fly in cooler weather than many other insects. Many species can “buzz pollinate,” vibrating flowers to shake out pollen (great for tomatoes and blueberries). They usually live in smaller colonies than honey bees, often in old rodent nests or underground. Bumble bees are generally not aggressive unless their nest is threatened.
