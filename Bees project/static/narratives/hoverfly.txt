Hoverfly 

Hoverflies are not bees at all, but many mimic bees and wasps with yellow-and-black patterns for protection. They hover in place with quick wingbeats and are harmless because they don’t sting. Adults often feed on nectar and pollen and can be good pollinators. Many hoverfly larvae eat aphids, which makes them helpful for natural pest control.
