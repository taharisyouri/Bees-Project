Yellowjacket 

Yellowjackets are social wasps that build nests underground or in wall cavities and defend them strongly. They eat other insects and also scavenge human food, which is why they show up at picnics. Late summer and fall they can seem more aggressive as their food sources change. Their stings can be painful and they can sting multiple times.
