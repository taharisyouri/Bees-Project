Paper wasp 

Paper wasps build open, umbrella-shaped nests made from chewed wood fibers that look like gray paper. They hunt caterpillars and other pests, which can help gardens. They’re more likely to sting if you get close to the nest, especially late summer when colonies are larger. Away from the nest, they’re often pretty calm.
