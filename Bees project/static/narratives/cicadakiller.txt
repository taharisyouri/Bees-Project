Cicada killer 

Cicada killers are large solitary wasps that look scary but are typically calm around people. The female hunts cicadas, paralyzes them, and drags them into a burrow as food for her larvae. They don’t form big aggressive colonies like yellowjackets, so stings are uncommon unless you grab or step on one. They can be helpful by naturally controlling cicada populations.
