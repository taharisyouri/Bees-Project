Carpenter bee 

Carpenter bees look a lot like bumble bees, but many have a shiny, less-hairy abdomen. They nest by chewing round holes into wood and making tunnels where they lay eggs, which can worry homeowners but usually causes only slow damage unless infestations repeat. Males often hover and act territorial but can’t sting; females can sting but usually don’t unless handled. They’re also good pollinators, especially for open-faced flowers.
