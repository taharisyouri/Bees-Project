Honey bee

Honey bees live in big colonies with a queen, workers, and drones. Workers collect nectar and pollen, then turn nectar into honey to store food. They communicate food locations with a “waggle dance.” Honey bees are major pollinators for many crops and wild plants, and they usually sting only when defending the hive.
